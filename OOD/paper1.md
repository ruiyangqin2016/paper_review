# Generalized Out-of-Distribution Detection: A SUrvey
OOD is relative to ID, which means in-distribution. For ID, the test dataset is from the same distribution as the training dataset. But in the real-world cases, the machine learning model might occur situations which don't belong to its data domain. There are five types of such situation: AD, ND, OSR, OOD, and OD. 
## Generalized OOD Detection
1. Anomaly Detection (AD): Detect any anomalous samples that are deviated from the predefined normality during testing. 
2. Novelty Detection (ND): Detect any test samples that do not fall into any training category. Prepared for future constructive procedures.
3. Open Set Recognition (OSR): OSR requires the multi-class classifier to simultaneously: (1) accurately classify test samples that from "known known class" and "detect test samples from unknown unknown class"
4. Out-of Distribution (OOD)
5. Outlier Detection (OD)
